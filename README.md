### Install

```bash
$ npm install -g katapult
```

### Usage

```bash
$ katapult --help

katapult <cmd> [args]

Commands:
  package      Package the build at the current working directory. (Invokes
               run-install, run-build, write-info, purge, and write-sum)
  run-install  Recursively runs the "install" directives starting at the current
               working directory.
  run-build    Recursively runs the "build" directives starting at the current
               working directory.
  purge        Wipes files not needed in the build based on the the "purge"
               globs.
  clear-cache  Clears the build cache in the configured workspace.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show help                                                [boolean]
  --version   Show version number                                      [boolean]
```

### .katapult.yml

You can automate installation, testing and build routines through the use of .katapult.yml files.
When packaging a build, katapult will recursively search the root directory for `.katapult.yml` files and run the directives they contain.

#### `install`

Allows the specification of one or more commands that are run before any of the `build` commands are run. `install` commands are run by traversing the build tree, *starting* at the root directory.
If any of the commands exits with a code other than `0`, the deployment is cancelled.

> After execution of the `install` commands in any directory, the build tree is rescanned - `install` commands may thus produce subfolders in turn containing `.katapult.yml` files which will be processed in a same way.

#### `build`

`build` commands are run by traversing the build tree, *ending* at the root directory.
If any of the commands exits with a code other than `0`, the deployment is cancelled.

#### command caching

Commands can be specified using two different types of syntax: plain and simple
```yaml
  - npm install
```
or using a more verbose (associative) syntax. The latter allows you to define additional options on a per-command basis, for example: command caching. Command caching can significantly increase build speeds.
```yaml
  - cmd: npm install
    input: package.json
    output: node_modules
```
Katapult will use [johnnycache](https://github.com/sgtlambda/johnnycache) and store the resulting files of the operation (in this case, the entire contents of `node_modules` after running `npm install`) to a `.tar.gz` archive in `.katapult/cache`.

#### `purge`

Allows the specification of one or more globs that will be used to delete unnecessary files; a *blacklist*, if you will. This allows you to, for example, remove the `node_modules` bloat after bundling a script with browserify.
It is also possible to define a "negating glob array" -- meaning all globs start with `!`. Katapult will treat such an array as a *whitelist* and remove all other files in the directory.

#### Example .katapult.yml

```yaml
install:
  - cmd: composer install
    input: composer.lock
    output: vendor

purge:
  - "!config"
  - "!vendor"
  - "!web"
```

### .katapultignore

Directories that match any of the globs specified in a .katapultignore file will not be traversed in the process of scanning for .katapult.yml files. You can also configure globs globally by creating `~/.katapultignore_global`:

```
**/node_modules
**/vendor
```
